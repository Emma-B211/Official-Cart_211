                        <h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
                        <p><strong> I am an Interactive Artist based in Montreal, Quebec Canada. I am currently
                                attending
                                Concordia University in the
                                Computation Arts. I have previously attended and graduated from Dawson College in the
                                program called Interactive Media Arts.</p>
                        <p> Throughout my life, I've had been exposed and surrounded with video games that during the
                            pandemic I have come to realized that
                            it was possible to pursue that as a career and it was what made me pursue cegep in
                            university to learn and improve so that I can be in the field once
                            I graduate from Concordia. </strong> </p>
