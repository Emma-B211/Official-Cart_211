                    <p> This is my final project during my second to last year of college, I was inspired by the aura at
                        the Basilica and recreated it
                        during my time and made it interactive.</p>

                    <h3> Left Behind</h3>
                    <p> I had gotten to create a video game in four months use UE4 inspired by Portal 2 but I had mixed
                        with the horror aspect of trying to find out why
                        the organization your character worked for was left abandond and there is something sinister
                        that had occured in your absense.</p>
